Streaming Live Video
The primary goal is to establish a real-time video stream from a robot with a Raspberry Pi (referred to as the “robot Pi”) to another Raspberry Pi acting as the server (referred to as the “server Pi”).
This setup enables remote monitoring, surveillance, or teleoperation of the robot.
